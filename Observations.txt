Idea : Maze
  I drew a grid over the maze that I wanted to program, and then noted the indices of all blocks in it.
  I blocked all parts where there was a wall, and then noted where was it allowed to go right, left, up and down.
  I made arrays of those indices, and created black blocks in places of wall.
  I programmed the handle function such that for the position of the circle, I took the index and checked it.
  If the pressed key was allowed, the circle moved, otherwise it stayed where it was.

Inheritance:
  The circle and rectangle class both inherit functions of widget class. I have overridden few functions, especially
  handle, in order to bend the widget class to function as per my requirement. I also added my own functions to the
  subclass, and then inherited that into another subclass. So Fl_Widget has 2 subclasses, MyRectangle and Shape, and 
  Shape has 1 subclass, MyCircle.
